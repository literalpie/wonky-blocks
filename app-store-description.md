#  App Store Description

> This is the description that shows up with that app in the app store. If anyone has a suggestion on different wording, open a PR to change this file. It's not automated or anything, but I will try to keep the app store description up to date with this.
You may notice I didn't mention Tetris by name. This is intentional.

An interesting twist on the classic puzzle arcade game we all love. By removing the restrictions of a grid and adding physics, this game is a new, yet familiar challenge.

As the pieces fall from the top of the board, your goal is to last as long as possible without the game area overflowing. Lines are removed when you fill them up with enough pieces. The longer you last, the faster pieces fall and the more points you get.

This is an open source game. Anyone can see the code on GitHub and contribute their own changes to the game.
