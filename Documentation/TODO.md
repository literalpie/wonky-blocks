#  TODO
* Move these items into github issues
* Handle multiple row removals
* break pieces into more than 2 pieces when row is removed
* Create enums for string constants (eg. node names)
* Attempt more refined joystick controls (small movements should cause slower piece movement)
* Increase speed at higher levels
* Pause on mobile (not just enter) (restart in menu?)
* Unit tests
* consider visual changes
