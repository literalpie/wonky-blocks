#  Taking Screenshots
This is how I took screenshots for the app store

* Change screen resolution on my 15" MBP to the "larger text" option (so UI elements are as big as possible)
* Make code changes to make the screenshot consistent
  * Change high score to 75,000
  * Make "pause" button always says "pause" (so they can't tell I'm pausing when I take the screenshots)
* Go full screen in the app, take a screenshot of the screen (make sure top bar is not visible)
* Edit screenshots size in Preview to be 1440x900
* Don't forget to move the mouse when screen recording!
